<p id="description">
The Smart Contact Manager is a Spring Boot project designed to efficiently manage user contacts. It provides features for user authentication, adding, editing, and deleting contacts, as well as organizing them into lists. The application employs a modern tech stack, including Spring Boot for the backend, Thymeleaf for server-side templating, and MySQL for database management. The project also integrates Spring Security for user authentication and authorization. Its clean and intuitive interface allows users to store and manage their personal contacts securely, while also providing search functionality and pagination for an improved user experience.
